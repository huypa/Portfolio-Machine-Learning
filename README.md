# FIT5201 – Statistical Machine Learning (S2 2024)

This repository contains my coursework for **FIT5201 – Statistical Machine Learning** completed in **Semester 2, 2024**.  
The assignments focus on both **theoretical foundations** and **practical implementations** of machine learning models using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📌 Assignment 1: Model Selection and Probabilistic Learning

### Description
This assignment studies model complexity, model selection, uncertainty estimation, and probabilistic machine learning.  
All core algorithms are implemented from scratch following *scikit-learn* conventions, without using high-level APIs that trivialize the tasks.

### Topics Covered
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression
- L-Fold Cross Validation
- Automatic model selection with nested cross-validation
- Ridge Regression with L2 regularization
- Logistic Regression vs Bayesian Classifiers

### Key Implementations
- Custom KNN Regressor and Cross-Validation splitter
- Internal cross-validation for hyperparameter selection
- Ridge Regression using analytical gradient derivation
- Comparative analysis of generative vs discriminative models
- Visualization of training/testing errors and learning curves

## 📌 Assignment 2: Unsupervised Learning and Neural Networks

### Description
This assignment focuses on unsupervised learning techniques and neural networks, emphasizing representation learning and model behavior analysis.

### Topics Covered
- Document clustering using Expectation-Maximization (EM)
- Perceptron vs multi-layer Neural Networks
- Autoencoders and self-taught learning
- Dimensionality reduction and visualization with PCA

### Key Implementations
- Hard-EM and Soft-EM for document clustering
- Numerical stability using the log-sum-exp trick
- Decision boundary comparison between linear and non-linear models
- Feature augmentation using autoencoder representations
- Performance comparison between standard and self-taught networks
